        <p>
          I have been trying to get into new hobbies lately, so I've just been
          doing whatever seems fun at the moment. Here are some of the things
          I've tried:
        </p>

        <h3>Tidepooling <span>(10/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          I am a huge nerd for marine life, so this was right up my alley. I
          went to Half Moon Bay with some friends and we found so many cool
          things! We saw sea stars, anemones, crabs, and even a small octopus!
          It was so fun to explore the tide pools and see all the different
          creatures. The only downside is that it‚Äôs cold and you can slip
          easily.
        </p>

        <h3>Birdwatching <span>(6/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          I downloaded an app called <em>Merlin Bird ID</em> and went to a
          nearby park to see what birds I could find. I saw a bunch of different
          species, and it was fun learning about them through the app and trying
          to identify them. However, it got a bit boring after a while, and most
          of the birds I saw were pretty common.
        </p>

        <h3>Feeding Stray Kittens in My Yard <span>(11/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          This has been the most rewarding hobby by far! I've been putting out
          food for the stray kittens in my neighborhood, and it's been so much
          fun to watch them come and go. I've named a few of them, but my
          favorite cat is definitely the runt that I lovingly named Sunny Side
          Down Egg. It's a great way to relax and de-stress, plus I feel like
          I'm making a difference in their lives. The only bad thing are the
          amount of yellowjackets that are attracted to the food, but it's worth
          it for the cute kittens.
        </p>

        <h3>Yoga <span>(4/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          I grew up doing yoga with my dad, so I thought maybe I would have come
          around to it by now. However, I still find it quite boring, and if I
          listen closely enough, I can still hear my dad's voice telling me to
          sit still and focus. I'll try again soon if I feel really stressed.
        </p>

        <h3>Bouldering <span>(3/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          I have a deadly fear of heights, so I thought this would be a good way
          to face my fears. However, I found that I was too scared to climb very
          high, and I didn't really enjoy it. Also, my friends are way better at
          it than me, so I got a bit butthurt.
        </p>

        <h3>Hiking <span>(7/10)</span></h3>
        <p>
          Again, the fear of heights kicked in, but the views make it worth it,
          and I have good stamina, so the hike was still enjoyable overall. I
          went to Mount Tamalpais and the views from the top were absolutely
          breathtaking!
        </p>

        <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
        <p>I need to try more hobbies.</p>
