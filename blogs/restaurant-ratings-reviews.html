          <p>
            One of my favorite things to do is eat, and lately I've thrown
            caution to the wind, neglected my bank account screaming out for
            help, and have tried a lot of local places. Here are my thoughts on
            some of them:
          </p>

          <h3>Seeds <span>(-1/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            I paid $9 for matcha that tasted like straight water. You could not
            pay me to go here again.
          </p>

          <h3>Madonna Inn <span>(3.5/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            I went there for brunch with my friends and the actual food was
            diner food that you would be able to get anywhere. However, the
            decor was absolutely insane. There are no words to describe it other
            than eclectic. I would go again if someone was paying for my meal,
            but I do not plan on spending that much for eggs and hash browns
            ever again.
          </p>

          <h3>Linnea's Cafe <span>(4/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            Maybe I came on an off day, but their matcha was incredibly watery
            and had no sweetness at all, even if I asked for banana syrup. I'll
            try out their coffee next time to give them another try.
          </p>

          <h3>Taqueria San Miguel <span>(6/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            I went there and ordered four tacos: carne asada, al pastor, pollo,
            and fish. All of the meats were dry, but had great flavor. However,
            I have had excellent tacos where the meat is both juicy and tasty,
            so this place didn't impress me much. Their California burrito was a
            bit better, but you could put guacamole and fries on a rubber shoe
            and I'd probably still eat it.
          </p>

          <h3>Petra Mediterranean Pizza and Grill <span>(6.5/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            This was one of the places I went for my WOW week. Pizzas were only
            $4 and some change, so I opted for their gyro pizza. It was fine,
            but nothing to write home about at all. It was tasty, but just
            average.
          </p>

          <h3>McConnell's Creamery <span>(7/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            I also went here during my WOW week. I got a scoop of their
            dairy-free fudge, and it was quite good. It doesn't hold a candle to
            Salt and Straw's hazelnut cookies and cream, but it's a fine
            substitute.
          </p>

          <h3>High Street Deli <span>(9/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            Their sandwiches are insanely good. I could write sonnets about
            their beef dip sandwich; the bread is so perfect and the meat is so
            insanely tender. The fact that their sandwiches are half off after
            4:20 is dangerous for my wallet.
          </p>

          <h3>Goshi <span>(11/10)</span></h3>
          <p>
            They have the best cuts of fish I have ever had in my life. I don't
            know who their supplier is or who their chef is, but they are doing
            incredible stuff here. The otoro melted in my mouth and even the
            maguro nigiri was so incredibly buttery. This is definitely my new
            favorite spot, much to the distress of my wallet.
          </p>

          <h3>Overall Thoughts</h3>
          <p>I should cook at home more.</p>
