      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <p>
        I am a student in <strong>Cal Poly's class of 2027</strong>, pursuing a
        major in <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I have been studying
        computer science ever since my time at <em>Ohlone College</em>, where I
        took my first foray into the field and <em>fell in love</em>. I am
        comfortable with coding in <strong>Python</strong>,
        <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I am always
        <em>eager to learn more</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I love <em>tidepooling</em> and looking at marine
        life, <em>birdwatching</em>, and <em>feeding the stray cats</em> in my
        neighborhood.
